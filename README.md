# Shamify-Backend

## Description 

This project is a back-end application for a fictional e-commerce site. This application uses Express.js API configured to Sequelize to interact with a SQL database. This application lacks a front-end and is tested using Insomnia. I was able to learn and impliment all CRUD operations thorugh this project and test them using Isomnia. The biggest challenge with this project was to ensure that the data was being sent through the correct parameters. 

## Installation 

In order to use this application, clone the repository onto your computer, and install node in order to run the application and using Insomnia, use the routes that are connected to the database. 

## Usage 

This application will allow the user to access the seeded data in the seeds folder and through insomnia allow the user to either add, modify or delete data within the database.
